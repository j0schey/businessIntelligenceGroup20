For portability reasons (relative file paths) the following steps are required to run kettle transformations and jobs:
in Spoon: Edit > Edit the Kettle.properties file > Add/change the variable 'basedirectory' to the root of the hand-in folder.
E.g.  D:\TU\BusinessIntelligence\Handson1\01_HandIn
Transformations and jobs are executed _without_ connecting to a file repository.
