Due to the fact that our dataset already consists of values in the interval [-1;1], the normalization to [0;1] has no impact on the overall results. Also the standardization of the training data, where a mean of 0 and a variance of 1 is achieved, shows no improvement on the results. We therefore concluded that no normalization or standardization is needed for our dataset.
